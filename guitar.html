            <h2>1. Standard Tuning</h2>
            <p>First, we'll start with the notes of the open strings in standard tuning. </br>
                Why do we tune the guitar in this "standard" way that we do?</br>
                TL;DR it's easier to play that way and it's been around since the 1500s. </br>
                If you need to brush up on your standard tuning knowledge, here's a refresher:</p>
                <img class="tuning" height="150px" src="./images/standard-tuning.png" alt="Standard Tuning">
                <p>The highest sounding string is the 1st string (e), the lowest sounding string is the 6th string (E). </br>
                (You wouldn't believe how many students get this wrong, even after years of playing).
                </p>
            <section>
                <h2>2. The Horizontal</h2>
                <p>Next, we're going to use the major scale to move horizontally up the fretboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why the major scale? </br>
                    Because it's the basis for everything in western music nowadays, which had its own evolution from
                    the
                    modes used in the Renaissance (but that's a whole other story).
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, a little refresher of the "formula" of the major scale: </br> 
                    Whole step - Whole step - Half step -
                    Whole step - Whole step - Whole step - Half step </br>
                    C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C</br>
                    Do - Re - Mi - Fa - Sol - La - Si - Do
                </p>
                <p>Here's what that looks like on the 2nd string:
                </p>
                
                <div>
                <img class="fretboard" src="./images/C Scale - 2.png" alt="C Major - B string">
                </div>

                <p>Next, we'll play the major scale horizontally across all six strings. </br>
                You can flip through the strings below:
                </p> 

                <div class="slider-container">
                    <img id="slider-image-2" class="slider-img" src="imageA.jpg" alt="Displayed Image 2">
                    <div class="slider-nav">
                        <button id="prev-btn-2" class="slider-button">‹ Prev</button>
                        <button id="next-btn-2" class="slider-button">Next ›</button>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    One thing we can note is that the major scale consists of two "tetrachords" (basically a four-note scale segment).</br> 
                    <img src="./images/tetrachord.png" alt="Tetrachord"></br>
                    Some may say this is "the key" to the major scale on the fretboard, because it's a symmetrical shape, but it creates a diagonal shape across the fretboard.</br>
                    The guitar works with positions and diagonal shapes don't stay within one position. That's also why we're not going to be using a strict 3-note-per-string fingering as the basis of our practice, but a variant of it (but I'm getting ahead of myself).</br>
                    It's more an interesting thing to notice than a real "hack" to unlock the fretboard.

                <p>
                    If we only take every C note from those scales and connect them, we get these <u>octave patterns</u>:</br>
                    <img class="fretboard" src="./images/C Octaves.png" alt="C Octaves Full Fretboard">
                </p>
                <p>Have a scroll through the different octave shapes below:</p>
                <div class="slider-container">
                    <img id="slider-image" class="slider-img" src="image1.jpg" alt="Displayed Image">
                    <div class="slider-nav">
                        <button id="prev-btn" class="slider-button">‹ Prev</button>
                        <button id="next-btn" class="slider-button">Next ›</button>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Your root is the most important note; it's your anchor. It's the relation between the root and all
                    the other notes that will determine the resulting sonority; everything is in relation to the root.
                    </br>
                    The better you find and can see your root notes, the more freedom, command and insight you'll have
                    over the fretboard
                </p>

                <h2>4. Navigating The Matrix</h2>
                <p>This little concept will make your thinking (and by extension your practicing) very organized and very clear.</p>
                <p>
                    On every root note we have 3 general directions in which the rest of the arpeggio/scale goes.</br>
                    We can continue “behind” the note (Left), “on” the note (Down) or “after” the note (Right).</br>
                    Every single possibility is contained within these 3 directions and once you have these core principles down you’ll never get lost on the fretboard again.
                </p>
                <h3>3 Directions</h3>

                </section>
                <p>Let's see how that works if we cycle the directions on our Cs.</p>
                <div class="slider-container">
                    <img id="slider-image-3" class="slider-img" src="imageA.jpg" alt="C Major 1-2-3">
                    <div class="slider-nav">
                        <button id="prev-btn-3" class="slider-button">‹ Prev</button>
                        <button id="next-btn-3" class="slider-button">Next ›</button>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h2>Putting it together</h2>
                <p>Let’s now combine this with our octave patterns and play a C Major scale in different positions.</p>
                <p>We’re not going to start at the very first possibility to play a C major scale on the neck, because that would involve using the open strings. 
                    For this first step I want you to see the fingering and with open strings it gets a little muddled. Not to worry though, they will be added back in later on.</p>
                <h3>Left</h3>
                    <p>Let’s start in 5th position, meaning your index finger will be at the 5th fret.
                Your pinky will then be at the 8th fret. 
                8th fret, 6th string = C</br>
                From there we’ll go into our first “category”; we’re going to continue behind the note.</p>
                <h3>Down</h3>
                <p>Next we’re going to shift to the 7th position, so that our index finger is on the 7th fret and our middle finger is on the C on the 8th fret.</br>
                From here we’re going to complete the scale going straight down.
                </p>
                <h3>Right</h3>
                <p>And finally we’ll shift over one last time and we’ll have our index finger on the 8th fret, so we’re in 8th position.</br>
                From here we continue after the note.
                </p>
